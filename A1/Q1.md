INSTRUCTIONS
All problems must be solved using C++ and compile/execute correctly on the Rigel cluster. You may test and debug in your local machine but the final evaluation will be done on Rigel.

All performance numbers given in your report should be on Rigel compute nodes. Profiling experiments should be run during your assigned timeslot to avoid performance interference. We should be able to reproduce your performance results.

You are required to actively use Copilot to solve the programming part of the problem, to generate the solution code and to test code. You are responsible for checking the accuracy of the code, including edge cases.

You MUST NOT collaborate with other students or take help from other (non-copilot) online sources to solve any parts of the problem, including code, prompts, algorithms, time/space complexity, etc.

You are provided a main.cpp file which calls helper functions for tasks such as file reading. By default, this uses the sample input and output provided by us. You can edit the file paths in main.cpp if you need to change the input files. You must not change anything else in main.cpp. We will run our own test cases using this file, so any modifications beyond the allowed changes could affect your evaluation. You are also not allowed to change the other files used for file operations (fileWriter.h, fileIterator.h).

All functions you write should be added to the user.h file. You must adhere to the function signatures specified in user.h. You are allowed to add additional helper functions to user_code.h if necessary, as long as the main function signatures remain unchanged.

DO NOT PRINT ANYTHING TO CONSOLE from code you write in the final submission. Your code will be auto-graded. So any deviations from instructions will cause grading to fail and you will get zero points.

CONTEXT. You are given details about product hashtags and customer purchases of products on an eCommerce website. Each product (int) is assigned a set of one or more hashtags (strings). Each customer (int) has purchased one or more products (ints). Each product has an associated price (float). The same product may have been purchased multiple times.

Q1. (9 points = 4 points for correct code + 4 points for report and analysis + 1 point for copilot survey and inline prompt documentation)
Group customers into clusters based on the similarity of their primary interests. A customer who purchases a product is associated with all its hashtags. Each purchase adds those hashtags to the customer's interest list. The number of occurrences of a hashtag in their interest list reflects its popularity. A customer's top-k most frequent hashtags in descending order represent their primary interests. Two customers are said to have similar interests if their primary interest hashtag lists exactly match. The goal is to identify and group customers with similar interests.

(A) Complete the code template you are provided. Ensure that the code is correct for different inputs. You are provided one sample, but need to generate others using the oracle link provided below. Provide in-line documentation of the prompts used in different parts of your code by prefixing the line with '//#PROMPT#'.

INPUT: Three iterators over (1) Products and their hashtags (2) Customers and their purchases and (3) products and their prices. 

OUTPUT: Return a list of customers (int), one per clustered group.

Function signature void groupCustomersByHashtags(fileIterator& hashtags, fileIterator& purchases, fileIterator& prices, string outputFilePath)

Sample input and output for sanity check:
inputs/product.csv
inputs/customer.csv
outputs/groups.csv
You will need to generate additional input datasets to verify the correctness of your code. You can use the oracle link below to generate valid outputs for any given input.

NOTE: (*) Use this "oracle" to get out the expected correct answer to any sample inputs or corner cases. https://codecheck.io/files/24090204303mnr174bmc8t0ja307paa78a6

(B) Submit a detailed report with experiment results, plots (with proper axes, titles, units, etc.), observations and analysis of why you are observing these results. Report the time and space complexity for your solution to Q1. In particular, separately report the time taken and worst/best/expected time complexity for reading and populating your data structure, for finding the clusters, and for writing the output to file. Also report the space complexity and memory usage for your algorithm. Show experimental evidence using different input sizes to support your claims. Document how your performed your observations and any tools you used.

(C) Complete the copilot survey: TBD
