## Submission Instructions (Teams)  

Please submit a zipped file `iischandle.zip` where you will replace `iischandle` with the prefix of your IISc email (e.g., `prashanthis` if your IISc email is `prashanthis@iisc.ac.in`). Inside this zip file, you will have a single folder named `iischandle/` and within this folder include exactly two files:
  1. `user_code.h` – This file should contain all of your code.
  2. `iischandle.pdf` – This file should include your experimental setup, observations and analysis, plots, and any other required documentation and acknowledgements.
So this will be how the file is structured.
```
iischandle.zip
|--iischandle\
   |-- user_code.h
   |-- iischandle.pdf
```
**Any deviation from the specified file or folder names and failure to follow the instructions for completing the assignment *will* result in a penalty.**

We will separately share a feedback form on Copilot to be filled, TBD.
